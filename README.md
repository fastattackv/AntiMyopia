AntiMyopia is a program to remind you to do visual breaks to rest your eyes and try to slow down myopia.
It makes a notification every 30 minutes by default reminding you to rest your eyes.


# Installation
To install AntiMyopia, download the installer named `AntiMyopia Installer.exe` from [here](https://github.com/fastattackv/AntiMyopia/raw/main/AntiMyopia%20Installer.exe) and execute it.
Follow the instructions and the program should now be installed on your computer.
By default, the program will start with windows but you can deactivate it from the program parameters.


# Usage
The program does not have an interface because it really does not need one.
To interact with it, use its icon in the system tray on the bottom right of your screen by clicking the little arrow to show running icons.
You can then right-click on the AntiMyopia icon and interact with the program from there.


# Uninstallation
To uninstall the program, first close the running application by clicking the stop button in its menu.
Then search for AntiMyopia in windows applications list and select uninstall.
